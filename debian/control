Package: libdex-1-1

Description: Library for deferred execution
 Dex is a library supporting "Deferred Execution" with the explicit goal of
 integrating with GNOME and GTK-based applications. It provides primatives
 for supporting futures in a variety of ways with both read-only and writable
 views. Additionally, integration with existing asynchronous-based APIs is
 provided through the use of wrapper promises.
 .
 "Fibers" are implemented which allows for writing synchronous looking code
 which calls asynchronous APIs from GIO underneath.
